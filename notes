THRUSTER RESEARCH:

I = moment of inertia

ratio of angular to translation accel (and force) (tranForce and angForce) is governed by distance to center (r), where @ R = 0,  tranForce = totForce, angForce = 0, and @ R=infinity, tranForce = 0 and angForce  = totForce.

the linear acceleration should be given by tranForce/M = A, where M is the object's mass.
rotational accel should involve SOME sort of angle. Is it just angForce/(M*radius)?

is tranForce+angForce = totForce?

(0,1),(inf,1)

angular accel SHOULD be:
totForce X vectorR/I((m/12)*(Math.pow(h,2)+Math.pow(w,2)))
 OR
radiusFromCenter*totForce*Math.sin(Math.PI*ang/180)/((m/12)*(Math.pow(h,2)+Math.pow(w,2)))


r X F/I

m*kg            1 
------------- = ------------- =
kg*m*m*m *s*s   m^2 s^2


m * kg/(m*s^2)  
------------- =
kg*m*m         


We'll need to assume the shape of the ship @ some point. Either sphere or retangular plane

change in KEtot is work done on object, which we (may?) be able to find from accel/force?

angForce = r* F sin(theta), where theta is angular btwn force dir and radius (r)

rotForce = Torque/I

FUNCTION: 
given mass M, (x,y) from cg/cm, and force denoted by 'P' property of thruster, determine first rotational force, then translational force.

IDEA:
move all object so that MIN object and MAX object are centered around... center.
Then coords should be dist to center.

if dim is even && > 1, +.5?
 - .5?

cases:
4 wide: 2.5
3 wide: 2 is middle
2 wide:1.5
1 wide: (special case?) 1 is middle
